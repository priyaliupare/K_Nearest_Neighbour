The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. It's easy to implement and understand, but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slows as the size of that data in use grows.

# example

KNN algorithms decide a number k which is the nearest Neighbor to that data point that is to be classified. If the value of k is 5 it will look for 5 nearest Neighbors to that data point. In this example, if we assume k=4. KNN finds out about the 4 nearest Neighbors.
